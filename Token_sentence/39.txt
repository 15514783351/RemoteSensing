With the development of hardwares such as mobile devices and portable depth cameras, on-line 3D reconstruction on the mobile devices with depth streams as input turns to be possible and promising.
Most existing systems use volumetric representation methods to fuse the depth images and use ICP algorithm to estimate the poses of cameras.
However, ICP tracker suffers from large drift in scenes containing insufficient geometric information.
To deal with this problem, we propose a stability based sampling method which select different number of point-pairs in different windows according to their geometric stability.
In addition, we fuse the ICP tracker with the IMU information through an analysis of the condition number.
Then we apply the stability based sampling method to the spatially hashed volumetric representation.
Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of tracking accuracy and 3D reconstruction results show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art systems, especially in scenes lacking sufficient geometric information.
In total, our method achieves frame rates 20 Hz on an Apple iPad Air 2 and 200 Hz on a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU.
