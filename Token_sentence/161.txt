Standard chlorophyll-a (chl-a) algorithms, which rely on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) data aboard the Aqua satellite, usually show different performances depending on the area under consideration.
In this paper, we assessed their accuracy in retrieving the chl-a concentration in the Basilicata Ionian Coastal waters (Ionian Sea, South of Italy).
The outputs of one empirical (Med-OC3) and two semi-analytical algorithms, the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) and the Generalized Inherent Optical Properties (GIOP) model, have been compared with ground measurements acquired during three different measurement campaigns.
The achieved results prove the poor accuracy (adjusted R-2 value of 0.12) of the investigated empirical algorithm and, conversely, the good performance of semi-analytical algorithms (adjusted R-2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.79).
The co-existence of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and Non-Algal Particles (NAP) has likely determined large errors in the reflectance ratios used in the OCx form algorithms.
Finally, a local scale assessment of the bio-optical properties, on the basis of the in situ dataset, allowed for the definition of an operational local scale-tuned version of the MODIS chl-a algorithm, which assured increased accuracy (adjusted R-2 value of 0.86).
Such a tuned algorithm version can provide useful information which can be used by local authorities within regional management systems.
