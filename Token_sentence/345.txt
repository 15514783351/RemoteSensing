The availability of precipitation data is the key driver in the application of hydrological models when simulating streamflow.
Ground weather stations are regularly used to measure precipitation.
However, spatial coverage is often limited in low-population areas and mountain areas.
To overcome this limitation, gridded datasets from remote sensing have been widely used.
This study evaluates four widely used global precipitation datasets (GPDs): The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), against point gauge and gridded dataset observations using multiple monthly water balance models (MWBMs) in four different meso-scale basins that cover the main climatic zones of Peninsular Spain.
The volumes of precipitation obtained from the GPDs tend to be smaller than those from the gauged data.
Results underscore the superiority of the national gridded dataset, although the TRMM provides satisfactory results in simulating streamflow, reaching similar Nash-Sutcliffe values, between 0.70 and 0.95, and an average total volume error of 12% when using the GR2M model.
The performance of GPDs highly depends on the climate, so that the more humid the watershed is, the better results can be achieved.
The procedures used can be applied in regions with similar case studies to more accurately assess the resources within a system in which there is scarcity of recorded data available.
