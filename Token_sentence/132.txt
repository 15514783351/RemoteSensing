A new closed-form expression is derived in this paper for computing the electromagnetic field reflected by two moving parallel interfaces.
Next, the interfaces velocities and refractive index between interfaces are derived from measurable frequencies and amplitudes embedded in the reflected electromagnetic field.
As an application, the remote analysis of the shock wave phenomenon in solids is reported and shock wave descriptors are estimated.
Based on the proposed approach, physical insights on measurement published results are reported.
Moreover, new measurement data on shocked polymethyl methacrylate material are presented and discussed.
