In the article we present an analytic aspect of TLS multi-station least-squares adjustment with the main focus on the datum problem.
The datum problem is, compared to previously published researches, theoretically analyzed and solved, where the solution is based on nullspace derivation of the mathematical model.
The importance of datum problem solution is seen in a complete description of TLS multi-station adjustment solutions from a set of all minimally constrained least-squares solutions.
On a basis of known nullspace, estimable parameters are described and the geometric interpretation of all minimally constrained least squares solutions is presented.
At the end a simulated example is used to analyze the results of TLS multi-station minimally constrained and inner constrained least-squares adjustment solutions.
