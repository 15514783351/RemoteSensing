Since 2007, green tides caused by massive blooms of Enteromorpha prolifera have occurred in the Yellow Sea during April and September every year.
Generally, the macroalgae first gathered around the Jiangsu coastline and then moved northeastward toward the Shandong Peninsula, but the paths and distribution of green tides have featured obvious inter-annual variation.
Here, we describe a new method to forecasting the drift path of green tides with some climate indices such as Nino3.4.
This method may help policy makers to develop a strategy to prevent green tide disasters and mitigate the consequence more effectively.
