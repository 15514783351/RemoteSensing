The knowledge of atmospheric column water vapor concentration is crucial for compensating water absorption effects in remote sensing data.
Several algorithms for the estimation of such a parameter were proposed in the past.
One of the most effective algorithms is the atmospheric precorrected differential absorption (APDA) technique.
APDA relies on a simplified radiative transfer model (RTM) that does not account for the spatial variability of the adjacency effects.
In this paper, we study the impact of the simplified RTM assumption on the performance of the algorithm by exploiting a more realistic and well-established RTM.
Starting from such a model, we derive a new water retrieval algorithm called low-rank subspace projection-based water estimator.
It exploits the high degree of spectral correlation experienced in the reflectances of most of the existing materials.
An extensive experimental analysis is carried out on simulated data in order to assess and compare the performance of the two algorithms.
Simulation results allow the critical analysis of the two algorithms by highlighting their strengths and drawbacks.
