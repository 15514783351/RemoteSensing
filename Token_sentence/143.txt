Spatiotemporal fusion of remote sensing data is essential for generating high spatial and temporal resolution data by taking advantage of high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution imageries.
At present, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is one of the most widely used spatiotemporal fusion technologies of remote sensing data.
However, the quality of data acquired by STARFM depends on temporal information from homogeneous land cover patches at the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery, and the estimation accuracy of STARFM degrades in highly fragmentated and heterogeneous patches.
To address this problem, we developed an innovative method to improve fusion accuracy, especially in areas of high heterogeneity, by combining linear pixel unmixing and STARFM.
This method derived the input data of STARFM by downscaling the MODIS data with a linear spectral mixture model.
Through this fusion method, the complement effect of the advantages of remote sensing information can be realized, and the multi-source remote sensing data can be realized for visual data mining.
The developed fusion method was applied in Bosten Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, and our analysis of results suggests that (1) after introducing the linear spectral mixture model, the fusion images illustrated improved spatial details to a certain extent and can be employed to identify small objects, as well as their texture distribution information; (2) for fragmented and highly heterogeneous areas, a stronger correlation between the predicted results and the real images was observed when compared to STARFM with small bias; and (3) the predicted red band and near infrared band can generate high-precision 16-m NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data with advantages in both spatial resolution and temporal resolution.
The results are generally consistent with the Gaofen-1 wide field of view cameras (GF-1 WFV) NDVI in the same period and therefore can reflect the spatial distribution of NDVI in detail.
