The velocity of ice flow in the Antarctic is a crucial factor to determine ice discharge and thus future sea level rise.
Feature tracking has been widely used in optical and radar imagery with fine resolution to retrieve flow parameters, although the primitive result may be contaminated by noise.
In this paper, we present a series of modified post-processing steps, such as SNR thresholding by residual, complex Butterworth filters, and triple standard deviation truncation, to improve the performance of primitive results, and apply it to MODIS-based Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA) datasets.
The final velocity field result displays the general flow pattern of the peripheral Antarctic.
Seventy-eight out of 97 streamlines starting from seed points are smooth and continuous.
The RMSE with 178 manually selected tie points is within 60 m.a(-1).
The systematic comparison with Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) datasets in seven drainages shows that the results regarding high magnitude and large-scale ice shelf are highly reliable; absolute mean and median difference are less than 18 m.a(-1), while the result of localized drainage suffered from too much tracking error.
The relative differences from manually selected and random points are controlled within 8% when speed is beyond 500 m.a(-1), but bias and uncertainty are pronounced when speed is lower than that.
The result through our accuracy control strategy highlights that coarse remote-sensed images such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer (MODIS) can still offer the capability for comprehensive and long-term continental ice sheet surface velocity mapping.
