A methodology for the measurement of height in water reservoirs is developed.
It is based on Sentinel 2 imagery and aerial LiDAR data.
The methodology is automatized using Matlab software and focused on image processing techniques (equalization, binarization, and edge detection) combined with LiDAR data processing (near neighbour search and height averaging).
It is applied in a region of interest selected by the user characterized by a water-land interface.
Results are validated in the As Conchas water reservoir (Spain) using an in situ sensing system provided by the Hydrographic Mino-Sil Confederation.
The duration of the experiment was one year.
The Sentinel 2 bands B2, B3, B4, and B8 were tested during this study.
The best results for water height evaluation were obtained for band B8 (842 nm) with an error of 0.20 m and a standard deviation of 0.17 m.
The time resolution of the technique depends on the Sentinel 2 revisit time.
The time resolution and height accuracy could be improved using complementary satellite systems.
