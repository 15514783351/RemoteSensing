Hyperspectral Band Selection (BS) aims to select a few informative and distinctive bands to represent the whole image cube.
In this paper, an unsupervised BS framework named the band priority index (BPI) is proposed.
The basic idea of BPI is to find the bands with large amounts of information and low correlation.
Sequential forward search (SFS) is used to avoid an exhaustive search, and the objective function of BPI consist of two parts: the information metric and the correlation metric.
We proposed a new band correlation metric, namely, the joint correlation coefficient (JCC), to estimate the joint correlation between a single band and multiple bands.
JCC uses the angle between a band and the hyperplane determined by a band set to evaluate the correlation between them.
To estimate the amount of information, the variance and entropy are used as the information metric for BPI, respectively.
Since BPI is a framework for BS, other information metrics and different mathematic functions of the angle can also be used in the model, which means there are various implementations of BPI.
The BPI-based methods have the advantages as follows: (1) The selected bands are informative and distinctive. (2) The BPI-based methods usually have good computational efficiencies. (3) These methods have the potential to determine the number of bands to be selected.
The experimental results on different real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the BPI-based methods are highly efficient and accurate BS methods.
