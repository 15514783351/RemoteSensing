The supervised deep networks have shown great potential in improving the classification performance.
However, training these supervised deep networks is very challenging for hyperspectral image given the tact that usually only a small amount of labeled samples are available.
In order to overcome this problem and enhance the discriminative ability of the network, in this paper, we propose a deep network architecture for a super-resolution (SR)-aided hyperspectral image classification with classwise loss (SRCL).
First, a three-layer SR convolutional neural network (SRCNN) is employed to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a low-resolution image.
Second, an unsupervised triplet-pipeline CNN (TCNN) with an improved classwise loss is built to encourage intraclass similarity and interclass dissimilarity.
Finally, SRCNN, TCNN, and a classification module are integrated to define the SRCL, which can be fine-tuned in an end-to-end manner with a small amount of training data.
Experimental results on real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed SRCL approach outperforms other state-of-the-art classification methods, especially for the task in which only a small amount of training data are available.
