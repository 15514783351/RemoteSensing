Individual tree crown detection and delineation (ITCD) mainly depend on high-resolution aerial photos and satellite images or LiDAR, and these data can be costly to obtain.
The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology provides an economic and effective method for data acquisition.
Therefore, the research of ITCD based on UAV high-resolution images is of significance to improve the efficiency and accuracy of forest resource inventory and remote sensing validation.
However, in very high-resolution (defined here with the pixel size smaller than 10 cm) images, the inhomogeneities in the canopy texture can be detrimental to the correct detection of individual trees by computer processing.
We applied the bias field estimation, which is used in medical image segmentation, to reduce the within-canopy spectral heterogeneity in the very high-resolution UAV-derived orthophoto.
By selecting young Osmanthus and Podocarpus trees that grow in a nursery as the study objects, we tested our method in an orthophoto (with a ground resolution of 2.5 cm) generated from overlapping UAV images.
A local intensity clustering was first applied to produce a smoothed bias field image; then, by using morphological operation of opening and closing, the fine texture of the canopy was further smoothed.
Finally, individual tree crowns were extracted by applying the marker-controlled watershed segmentation algorithm.
The segmentation results were validated by comparing to the manually drawn individual tree crown polygons.
The F-scores of the detection rate for Osmanthus and Podocarpus were 98.2% and 93.1%, respectively.
The result is considerably better than those achieved with similar processing steps but without the bias field treatment.
Our study proves that it is feasible and effective to detect and delineate individual tree crowns based on the bias field and marker-controlled watershed segmentation in very-high-resolution images obtained from UAV.
