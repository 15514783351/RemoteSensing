Convolutional neural network obtains remarkable achievements on target detection, due to its prominent capability on feature extraction.
However, it still needs further study for aircraft detection task, since intraclass variation still restricts the accuracy of aircraft detection in remote sensing images.
In this letter, we adopt regularity of aircraft circle response to design our end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN), and embed online exemplar mining into our network to handle intraclass variation.
The mined exemplars are employed to capture different intraclass characteristics, which effectively reduces the burden of network training.
Specifically, we first select basic exemplars based on labeled information and initialize the relationships between exemplars and aircraft examples.
Then, these relationships will he updated by the similarity of these examples in high-level features space.
Finally, aircraft examples will be used to train different exemplar detectors according to updated relationships.
Motivated by the geometric shape of aircraft, a circle response map is developed to construct our FCN to achieve more efficient aircraft detection.
The comparative experiments indicate that superior performance of our network in accurate and efficient aircraft detection.
