With recent advances in polarimetry, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with Hybrid-polarity architecture, a demonstration of compact polarimetry enabled larger swath coverage, reduced PRF and SAR system complexity as compared to fully polarimetric systems.
The first Hybrid Polarimetric Space-borne SAR in Earth Observation orbit, India's Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT-1) is a new-fangled gateway to remote sensing user community for land and oceanic applications.
In response to a right-circular polarized transmitted signal, based on the derived stokes vectors, Stokes parameters are estimated to produce several useful quantitative measures for generating polarimetric decomposed image. m-delta, m-chi and m-alpha polarimetric decomposition methods along with suitable weighting functions in terms of three principal components are implemented which maps Stokes parameters to RGB image space for representing odd bounce, even bounce and volume scattering targets.
Various RISAT-1 Hybrid Fine Resolution Stripmap Single-Look Complex SAR datasets acquired over deployed corner reflectors at calibration site, Shadnagar have been considered over which different hybrid polarimetric decomposition techniques are implemented using in-house developed software.
Further analysis produced encouraging results with standard point targets like dihedral and trihedral corner reflectors against distributed targets in the same scene to demonstrate the scattering mechanisms as per their characteristics when interacted with a polarized signal were presented in this paper.
