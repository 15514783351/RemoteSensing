Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important parameters in land surface processes.
Although satellite-derived LST can provide valuable information, the value is often limited by cloud contamination.
In this paper, a two-step satellite-derived LST reconstruction framework is proposed.
First, a multi-temporal reconstruction algorithm is introduced to recover invalid LST values using multiple LST images with reference to corresponding remotely sensed vegetation index.
Then, all cloud contaminated areas are temporally filled with hypothetical clear-sky LST values.
Second, a surface energy balance equation-based procedure is used to correct for the filled values.
With shortwave irradiation data, the clear-sky LST is corrected to the real LST under cloudy conditions.
A series of experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.
Quantitative evaluation results indicate that the proposed method can recover LST in different surface types with mean average errors in 3-6K.
The experiments also indicate that the time interval between the multi-temporal LST images has a greater impact on the results than the size of the contaminated area.
