Geospatial object detection from high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery is a heated and challenging problem in the field of automatic image interpretation.
Despite convolutional neural networks (CNNs) having facilitated the development in this domain, the computation efficiency under real-time application and the accurate positioning on relatively small objects in HSR images are two noticeable obstacles which have largely restricted the performance of detection methods.
To tackle the above issues, we first introduce semantic segmentation-aware CNN features to activate the detection feature maps from the lowest level layer.
In conjunction with this segmentation branch, another module which consists of several global activation blocks is proposed to enrich the semantic information of feature maps from higher level layers.
Then, these two parts are integrated and deployed into the original single shot detection framework.
Finally, we use the modified multi-scale feature maps with enriched semantics and multi-task training strategy to achieve end-to-end detection with high efficiency.
Extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations on a publicly available 10-class object detection dataset have demonstrated the superiority of the presented method.
