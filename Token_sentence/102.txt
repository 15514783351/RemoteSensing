The global optimal solution (GOS) has proven to be very accurate for deriving water surface velocities from contemporaneous image pairs, but previous studies have used shore-based radars or satellite measurements with resolutions on the order of a kilometer or tens of meters to establish this.
In contrast, the objective of this paper is to derive a GOS velocity field from infrared (IR) (3-5 mu m) images having a 1-m pixel size.
Because IR images can frequently exhibit a low signalto-noise ratio, a newly developed GOS technique with a local similarity metric is used to retrieve velocities from such low-contrast data sets.
To demonstrate the utility of this new method, we use airborne data collected in the tidal Potomac River over 11 days and spatially varying flood, ebb, and slack conditions.
The resulting GOS-derived velocity estimates are compared against acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements taken simultaneously with the airborne collections.
Velocity magnitudes and directions are found to have GOS versus ADCP correlations of 0.93 and 0.99, respectively.
This high correlation suggests that the GOS technique may be applicable to a variety of lower contrast imagery that can now be collected by a low-altitude remotely controlled aircraft.
