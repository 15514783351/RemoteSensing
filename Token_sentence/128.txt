The history of the development of works on the creation of the elemental base of adaptive optics for a solar Russian telescope is briefly described.
We consider separate issues of the development of the wavefront sensor (WFS) based on the Shack-Hartmann correlation sensor to provide measurements under conditions of strong turbulence.
The parameters of the WFS are calculated on the basis of long-term observations of meteorological characteristics and optical measurements of the Fried parameter.
A special adjusting device with a block of fast rasters changing is developed.
The use of rasters of various dimensions is provided in the WFS.
The sensor uses the original algorithm for determining the maximum of the correlation function.
The effect on the accuracy of measuring the phase distortions of turbulence occurring in the rooms of the telescope itself is analyzed.
