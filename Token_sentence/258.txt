Water supplies in northeastern Brazil strongly depend on the numerous surface water reservoirs of various sizes there.
However, the seasonal and long-term water surface dynamics of these reservoirs, particularly the large number of small ones, remain inadequately known.
Remote sensing techniques have shown great potentials in water bodies mapping.
Yet, the widespread presence of macrophytes in most of the reservoirs often impedes the delineation of the effective water surfaces.
Knowledge of the dynamics of the effective water surfaces in the reservoirs is essential for understanding, managing, and modelling the local and regional water resources.
