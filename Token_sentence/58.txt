Ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is essential in remote sensing but still full of challenges in the deep learning era.
The unbalanced dataset and lack of models are two limitations.
Upsampling with data augmentation and ratio batching are proposed to solve the first problem.
Upsampling with data augmentation is upsampling by cropping and flipping.
It can improve the diversity of the dataset.
Ratio batching is realized by choosing the same amount of ships per class in each minibatch.
It can make the model converge faster and better.
To solve the second problem, a new loss function and convolutional neural network model are proposed.
The new loss function can maximize the intraclass compactness and interclass separation simultaneously.
Dense residual network has two submodules.
One is the identity mapping through elementwise summation to reuse old features.
The other is dense connection through concatenation to exploit new features.
The designed architecture is suitable for the task of SAR ship classification.
We use the confusion matrix and accuracy averaged on classes to measure the performance.
From the experiments, we can find that the proposed ideas have excellent performance especially on the rare classes.
