Over the past 20 years, hyperspectral microscopy has grown into a robust field of analysis for a number of applications.
The visible to near-infrared (VNIR; 400 to 1000 nm) region of the spectrum has demonstrated utility for the characterization of healthy and diseased tissue and of biomolecular indicators at the cellular level.
Here, we describe the development of a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) microscope that is aimed at material characterization to complement traditional stand-off, earth remote sensing with hyperspectral sensors.
We combine commercial off the shelf technology to build an HSI microscope to collect spectral data with illumination provided by a tunable laser.
Hyperspectral imaging microscopy (HIM) facilitates detailed examination of target materials at the subcentimeter spatial scale.
The custom-built, laser illumination HSI microscope covers the NIR to shortwave infrared (NIR/SWIR; 900 to 2500 nm) solar-reflected spectral range.
It is combined with a separate VNIR sensor (400 to 900 nm) that utilizes quartz-tungsten-halogen lamps for illumination.
The combined sensors provide a means to collect >10,000 s of spectra in the full VNIR/SWIR spectral range from both pure substances and precisely engineered linear and nonlinear mixtures.
The large abundance of spectra allows for a more detailed understanding of the variability and multivariate probability distributions of spectral signatures.
This additional information aids in understanding the variability observed in ground truth spectra collected from portable spectrometers, and it greatly enhances sample description and metadata content.
In addition, HIM data cubes can serve as proxies, as "microscenes," for systems engineering applications such as trade studies for HSI acquired by air- and space-borne sensors.
