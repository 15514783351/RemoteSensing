Haze removal is a pre-processing step that operates on at-sensor radiance data prior to the physically based image correction step to enhance hazy imagery visually.
Most current haze removal methods focus on point-to-point operations and utilize information in the spectral domain, without taking consideration of the multi-scale spatial information of haze.
In this paper, we propose a multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (MRCNN) for haze removal of remote sensing images.
MRCNN utilizes 3D convolutional kernels to extract spatial-spectral correlation information and abstract features from surrounding neighborhoods for haze transmission estimation.
It takes advantage of dilated convolution to aggregate multi-scale contextual information for the purpose of improving its prediction accuracy.
Meanwhile, residual learning is utilized to avoid the loss of weak information while deepening the network.
Our experiments indicate that MRCNN performs accurately, achieving an extremely low validation error and testing error.
The haze removal results of several scenes of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data show that the visibility of the dehazed images is significantly improved, and the color of recovered surface is consistent with the actual scene.
Quantitative analysis proves that the dehazed results of MRCNN are superior to the traditional methods and other networks.
Additionally, a comparison to haze-free data illustrates the spectral consistency after haze removal and reveals the changes in the vegetation index.
