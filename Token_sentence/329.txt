We present here parameterizations of particulate and phytoplankton absorption coefficients as functions of pigment concentrations (Tchla) in Sognefjord and Trondheimsfjord along the northwestern coast of Norway.
The total particulate and non-algal optical densities were measured via quantitative filter technique (QFT) in a spectrophotometer with integrating sphere.
The spectral parameter coefficients A() and E() of the power law describing variations of particulate and phytoplankton absorption coefficients as a function of Tchla, were not only different from those provided for open ocean case 1 waters, but also exhibited differences in the two fjords under investigation.
Considering the influence of glacial meltwater leading to increased inorganic sediment load in Sognefjord we investigate differences in two different parameterizations, developed by excluding and including inner Sognefjord stations.
Tchla are modelled to test the parameterizations and validated against data from the same cruise and that from a repeated campaign.
Being less influenced by non-algal particles parameterizations performed well in Trondheimsfjord and yielded high coefficients of determination (R-2) of modelled vs. measured Tchla.
In Sognefjord, the modelled vs. measured Tchla resulted in better R-2 with parameter coefficients developed excluding the inner-fjord stations influenced by glacial meltwater influx.
