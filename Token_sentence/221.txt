The Central Gold Belt (CGB) of Malaysia is a major host to gold deposits.
Penjom, Raub, Selising and Buffalo reef are major gold mines in CGB.
The study area, Selinsing gold mine, is located at the northwest of Pahang province on the lineament known as the Raub Bentong Suture.
Presence of dense vegetation and cloud cover in tropical regions are main obstacles in alteration mapping using satellite imageries.
In this study, Landsat 8 and ASTER level 1B images were used to map clay minerals and quartz rich zones at Selinsing gold mine and surrounding areas.
Direct principal component analysis (DPCA), matched filtering (MF) and band ratio were the effective methods used in this study.
High concentration of clay minerals was detected using band ratio 6/7, DPC2 and MF and ratio 14/12 was carried out to highlight quartz rich zones.
The results of image processing methods were verified by in situ inspection and X-ray diffraction analyses.
The results show that, in spite of limited bedrock exposure, the known gold prospects and potential areas of mineralization can be recognized by the methods employed in this study.
