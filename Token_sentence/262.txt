Rice is one of the most important cereals in the world.
With the change of agricultural land, it is urgently neemcary to update information about rice planting areas.
This study aims to map rice planting areas with a field-based approach through the integration of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI data in Wuhua County of South China where has many basins and mountains.
This paper, using multi-temporal SAR and optical images, proposes a methodology for the identification of rice-planting areas.
This methodology mainly consists of SSM applied to time series SAR images for the calculation of a similarity measure, image segmentation process applied to the pan-sharpened optical image for the searching of homogenous objects, and the integration of SAR and optical data for the elimination of some speckles.
The study compares the per-pixel approach with the per field approach and the results show that the highest accuracy (91.38%) based on the field-based approach is 1.18% slightly higher than that based on the pixel-based approach for VH polarization, which is brought by eliminating speckle noise through comparing the rice maps of these two approaches.
Therefore, the integration of Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI images with a field-based approach has great potential for mapping rice or other crops' areas.
