Infrared image segmentation plays a significant role in many burgeoning applications of remote sensing, such as environmental monitoring, traffic surveillance, air navigation and so on.
However, the precision is limited due to the blurred edge, low contrast and intensity inhomogeneity caused by infrared imaging.
To overcome these challenges, a level set method using global and local information is proposed in this paper.
In our method, a hybrid signed pressure function is constructed by fusing a global term and a local term adaptively.
The global term is represented by the global average intensity, which effectively accelerates the evolution when the evolving curve is far away from the object.
The local term is represented by a multi-feature-based signed driving force, which accurately guides the curve to approach the real boundary when it is near the object.
Then, the two terms are integrated via an adaptive weight matrix calculated based on the range value of each pixel.
Under the framework of geodesic active contour model, a new level set formula is obtained by substituting the proposed signed pressure function for the edge stopping function.
In addition, a Gaussian convolution is applied to regularize the level set function for the purpose of avoiding the computationally expensive re-initialization.
By iteration, the object of interest can be segmented when the level set function converges.
Both qualitative and quantitative experiments verify that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art level set methods in terms of accuracy and robustness with the initial contour being set randomly.
